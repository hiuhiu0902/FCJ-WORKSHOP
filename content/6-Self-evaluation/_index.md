During my internship at **First Cloud Journey** from **September 2025** to **December 2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge acquired in school to a real-world working environment.

I participated in the **"High Availability Game Card Sales Platform on AWS"** project, through which I improved my skills in **Cloud Infrastructure (AWS), Backend Development (Java Spring Boot), System Architecture, and Chaos Engineering**.

In terms of work ethic, I always strived to complete tasks well, complied with workplace regulations, and actively engaged with colleagues to improve work efficiency.

To objectively reflect on my internship period, I would like to evaluate myself based on the following criteria:

| No. | Criteria | Description | Good | Fair | Average |

| 1 | **Professional knowledge & skills** | Understanding of AWS services, Spring Boot, and applying them to build the Game Card Platform. | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 2 | **Ability to learn** | Absorbed new concepts like Chaos Engineering, JWT Auth, and Multi-AZ architecture quickly. | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 3 | **Proactiveness** | Taking initiative in researching solutions (e.g., Secrets Manager, WAF) without waiting for instructions. | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 4 | **Sense of responsibility** | Completed weekly worklogs on time and ensured the project ran successfully. | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 5 | **Discipline** | Adhering to the 12-week roadmap and documenting progress daily. | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 6 | **Progressive mindset** | Willingness to receive feedback on code quality and security practices. | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 7 | **Communication** | Presenting technical ideas and reporting work clearly in the worklogs. | ☐ | ✅ | ☐ |
| 8 | **Teamwork** | Engaging with the community and mentors during events and workshops. | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 9 | **Professional conduct** | Respecting the learning environment and cloud resources (Cost optimization). | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 10 | **Problem-solving skills** | Identifying issues (e.g., Race Conditions) and solving them with Transactional locking. | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 11 | **Contribution to project/team** | Successfully deployed a working MVP with HA and Security standards. | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 12 | **Overall** | General evaluation of the entire internship period. | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
