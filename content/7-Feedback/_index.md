> Here, you can freely share your personal opinions about your experience participating in the First Cloud Journey program. This will help the FCJ team improve any shortcomings based on the following aspects:

### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**
The environment at the First Cloud Journey (FCJ) program is professional and encourages self-discipline. As an FPT student, I appreciate the modern workspace and the access to AWS resources. The atmosphere is open, but it also requires interns to be very proactive in their work.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**
The mentorship style here focuses heavily on self-study and independence. The mentor primarily focused on **reviewing my network architecture** designs for the final project rather than giving detailed step-by-step guidance. Feedback was generally minimal unless I explicitly raised questions or encountered specific blockers. However, when I did ask for clarification regarding the AWS services, the mentor was available to answer and explain the technical constraints.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**
The OJT is highly relevant to my major. I was able to apply my knowledge of Web Development and Networking to build the **Game Card Selling Web Application**. Moving from writing code to designing a complete cloud infrastructure (VPC, Subnets, EC2) was a valuable practical experience that school theory hadn't fully covered.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**
Because the mentor only stepped in when asked, I developed strong **self-research and problem-solving skills**. I learned to dig deep into AWS documentation to configure the VPC and RDS for my project. I also learned how to design a scalable network architecture that meets industry standards.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**
The culture promotes independence and "Ownership." Everyone is focused on their tasks. While it is not overly social, there is a sense of mutual respect. When I needed administrative support (like AWS credits or account access), the Admin team was quick and helpful.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**
The program provides good benefits, specifically the access to AWS learning materials and the allowance. The flexible schedule allowed me to manage my time effectively between the project and other university requirements.

### Additional Questions
- **What did you find most satisfying during your internship?**
The most satisfying part was when my **Game Card Selling Web** successfully ran on the architecture I designed myself. Since I didn't get too much hand-holding, getting the VPC and Security Groups to work correctly felt like a true personal achievement.

- **What do you think the company should improve for future interns?**
I think mentors could be a bit more proactive in giving feedback during the early stages of the design, rather than just waiting for questions. Sometimes interns don't know what they don't know, so a few more "checkpoint" reviews would be helpful.

- **If recommending to a friend, would you suggest they intern here? Why or why not?**
Yes, especially if they are strong at self-learning. This is a great place to force yourself to learn AWS deeply, but you shouldn't expect to be taught everything by hand.

### Suggestions & Expectations
- **Do you have any suggestions to improve the internship experience?**
It would be beneficial to have more technical sharing sessions where mentors critique architecture examples, so we can learn from common mistakes before building our own.

- **Would you like to continue this program in the future?**
Yes, I appreciate the challenge and would like to continue to learn more advanced AWS services.

- **Any other comments (free sharing):**
Thank you to the FCJ team for the opportunity to challenge myself and build a real-world cloud project.
