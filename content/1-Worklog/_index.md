**On this page**, I will introduce my worklog.

**How did I complete it?**
I diligently followed the "First Cloud Journey" roadmap, combining theoretical study via AWS Documentation and video tutorials with intensive **hands-on practice** using the AWS Console, CLI, and **Java Spring Boot** development. For every task, I documented the steps taken, errors encountered, and solutions found.

**How many weeks did it take?**
I completed this internship program over a period of **12 weeks** (3 months), starting in September 2025 and finishing in December 2025.

**What did I do in those weeks?**
Throughout these 12 weeks, I progressed from fundamental concepts (like IAM and Account Security) to designing and deploying a fully fault-tolerant, High Availability (HA) architecture for a **Game Card Sales Platform**, integrating a robust backend with automated recovery and global content delivery.

Below is the summary of my weekly progress:

**Week 1:** [Getting familiar with AWS and IAM Fundamentals](1.1-week1/)

**Week 2:** [Networking Deep Dive (VPC, Subnets, Stateful vs Stateless Firewalls)](1.2-week2/)

**Week 5:** [High Availability Architecture (ALB, ASG & Connection Draining)](1.5-week5/)

**Week 6:** [Data Layer: Managed Databases (RDS Multi-AZ) & Caching](1.6-week6/)

**Week 7:** [Connectivity & Security (NAT Gateway, WAF, Secrets Manager)](1.7-week7/)

**Week 8:** [Design Phase: Architecture Diagramming & Blast Radius Reduction](1.8-week8/)

**Week 9:** [Implementation: Infrastructure & Spring Boot Backend Setup](1.9-week9/)

**Week 10:** [Implementation: App Logic, Transactions & Auto Scaling](1.10-week10/)

**Week 11:** [Security & Auth: Spring Security (JWT), CloudFront & WAF](1.11-week11/)
